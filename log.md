# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Learned the fundamentals concepts of machine learning: what machine learning is, and the 2 main types (supervises and unsupervised learning) along with the examples of regression, classification, and clustering.

**Thoughts**:
Machine learning is very interesting, the idea of computers progressing through an experience to predict a future result is fascinating. Looking forward in applying the maths I've learned in school and uni.

**Learning Platform**:
Coursera: Machine Learning course by Stanford University

### Day 2: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Advancing on linear regression for machine learning: learned model representation, cost function, and gradient descent for linear regression. Reviewed linear algebra regarding matrices and vectors along with their operations and properties.

**Thoughts**:
Years of calculus and linear algebra are now proving to be useful, can't wait for learning how to truly apply these theories to computers.
