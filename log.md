# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Learned the fundamentals concepts of machine learning: what machine learning is, and the 2 main types (supervises and unsupervised learning) along with the examples of regression, classification, and clustering.

**Thoughts**:
Machine learning is very interesting, the idea of computers progressing through an experience to predict a future result is fascinating. Looking forward in applying the maths I've learned in school and uni.

**Learning Platform**:
Coursera: Machine Learning course by Stanford University

### Day 2: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Advancing on linear regression for machine learning: learned model representation, cost function, and gradient descent for linear regression. Reviewed linear algebra regarding matrices and vectors along with their operations and properties.

**Thoughts**:
Years of calculus and linear algebra are now proving to be useful, can't wait for learning how to truly apply these theories to computers.

### Day 3: June 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Learned new regression method of normal equation, its advantages and disadvantages compared to gradient descent, and how to overcome its noninvertibility problem.

**Thoughts**:
The comparison between gradient descent and normal equation is pretty interesting.

### Day 4: June 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Implemented cost function & gradient descent in Python (using the assignment from Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, converted to Python). Hours of trying to apply the equation to the code, and turns out vectorization helps a lot.

**Thoughts**:
Matrices are very tricky, and putting equation involving matrices into the code can be challenging to understand.
