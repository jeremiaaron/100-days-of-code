# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned the fundamentals concepts of machine learning: what machine learning is, and the 2 main types (supervises and unsupervised learning) along with the examples of regression, classification, and clustering.

**Thoughts** Machine learning is very interesting, the idea of computers progressing through an experience to predict a future result is fascinating. Looking forward in applying the maths I've learned in school and uni.

**Learning Platform**
Coursera: Machine Learning course by Stanford University
